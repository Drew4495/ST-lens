# fPCA for Spatial Transcriptomics

Functional Principal Component Analysis (fPCA) is a fast, accurate workflow for spatial domain detection in spatial transcriptomics that models gene expression as smooth functions over a finite-element mesh‚Äîpreserving complex tissue geometry (holes, non-convexities) and true spatial relationships. 
 
Compared with leading methods, fPCA runs substantially faster, achieves higher accuracy which was tested with simulated datasets with known ground truth.

It also provides inherent high-resolution reconstructions and scales to dense, high-coverage assays; results are demonstrated on HER2+ breast cancer, human DLPFC, and mouse cerebellum.

A non-convex shape is one that in which at least there exists a pair of points in which a straight line segment between them is contained completely within the shape itself. In the example below, the red lines satisfy this property while the blue line does not, indicating the right shape is non-convex.

## Pipeline (at a glance)

Order: **Meshing ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Analysis (Functional PCA) ‚Üí Decide # Components ‚Üí Clustering ‚Üí Visualization**

- **Meshing**  
  Build a hexagonal lattice over the tissue, simplify the boundary, and generate a **finite-element (FEM)** triangular mesh that matches the tissue shape.  
  _Output:_ `data/DLPFC/mesh.RData` (contains `mesh` and `lattice`)  
  _Figures:_ step-by-step PDFs in `images/DLPFC/meshing/` named `0_...pdf` through `9_...pdf`

- **Preprocessing**  
  Use SpatialPCA‚Äôs preprocessing to select spatially informative genes, filter spots/genes, normalize counts, then **z-score each gene** (row-wise `scale()`).  
  _Output:_ `data/DLPFC/preprocessed_data.RData`  
  _(Includes both the original ‚Äúsnapshots‚Äù and the processed `locations`, z-scored `counts`, names, and `true_labels`.)_

- **Analysis (Functional PCA = fPCA)**  
  Align data to the mesh domain (drop out-of-domain spots) and fit **fPCA** with **generalized cross-validation (GCV)** to choose smoothing. Save mean and component fields and evaluate them on a high-resolution grid and at spot locations.  
  _Outputs:_  
  - `results/DLPFC/fPCA.RData` (mean, scores, loadings, evaluated fields, timing)  
  - `data/DLPFC/analyzed_data.RData` (domain-aligned data; not fPCA results)  
  - _Figures:_ `images/DLPFC/analysis/1_HR_grid.pdf`, `2_mean.pdf`, `2_mean_at_locations.pdf`, `3_components_at_locations.pdf`  
  - _Note for timing scripts:_ `results/DLPFC/domain_input_for_FPCA.RData` (contains `mesh`, `counts`, `locations`; move the `save()` after grid creation if you want `grid` included)

- **Decide number of spatial components**  
  Plot the **normalized reconstruction error** (RMSE of data vs. fPCA low-rank reconstructions) across component counts and pick the elbow.  
  _Outputs:_  
  - `images/DLPFC/NSC_optimization/Optimal_nComp_Selection.pdf`  
  - `results/DLPFC/nComp_opt.RData` (e.g., `nComp_opt <- 3`)  

- **Clustering**  
  Run **Walktrap community detection** on the first `nComp_opt` fPCA components on a high-resolution grid, then assign each original spot the label of its nearest grid point. Score with **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** vs ground truth and **align cluster IDs** to ground-truth IDs via a greedy ARI-based mapping. (Also repeats for NSC = 8 and 2 for comparison.)  
  _Outputs (per NSC):_  
  - `results/DLPFC/fPCA_clustering_results_GCV_NoMean_{NSC}.RData` (lists of HR/LR labels and ARIs, keyed by `knearest_{K}`)  
  - `results/DLPFC/fPCA_clustering_results_ALIGNED_GCV_NoMean_{NSC}.RData` (aligned versions)  
  - _Figures:_ per-KNN PDFs in `images/DLPFC/clustering/GCV_NoMean/...`:  
    `HR_clustering_k{K}.pdf`, `clustering_k{K}.pdf`, plus `aggregated_KNN_HR_plot.pdf` and `aggregated_KNN_LR_plot.pdf`  

- **Visualization**  
  Export manuscript-style figures: **Ground Truth vs SpatialPCA vs fPCA** label maps (with ARI/CHAOS annotations) and selected spatial component maps (scaled and unscaled).  
  _Outputs:_ PDFs in `images/DLPFC/manuscript/` (e.g., `DLPFC_sample9_GroundTruth.pdf`, `DLPFC_sample9_SPCA.pdf`, `DLPFC_sample9_FPCA.pdf`, and component grids)
