# fPCA for Spatial Transcriptomics

Functional Principal Component Analysis (fPCA) is a fast, accurate workflow for spatial domain detection in spatial transcriptomics that models gene expression as smooth functions over a finite-element meshâ€”preserving complex tissue geometry (holes, non-convexities) and true spatial relationships. 
 
Compared with leading methods, fPCA runs substantially faster, achieves higher accuracy which was tested with simulated datasets with known ground truth.

It also provides inherent high-resolution reconstructions and scales to dense, high-coverage assays; results are demonstrated on HER2+ breast cancer, human DLPFC, and mouse cerebellum.

A non-convex shape is one that in which at least there exists a pair of points in which a straight line segment between them is contained completely within the shape itself. In the example below, the red lines satisfy this property while the blue line does not, indicating the right shape is non-convex.

## Pipeline (at a glance)

Order: **Meshing â†’ Preprocessing â†’ Analysis (fPCA) â†’ Decide NSC â†’ Clustering â†’ Visualization**

- **Meshing**: Build hex lattice, simplify domain, generate FEM mesh.  
  _Output:_ `data/DLPFC/mesh.RData` (+ stepwise PDFs)

- **Preprocessing**: SpatialPCA preprocessing + per-gene z-score.  
  _Output:_ `data/DLPFC/preprocessed_data.RData` (initial snapshots + processed data)

- **Analysis (fPCA)**: Domain alignment; fPCA with GCV; evaluate mean/components.  
  _Outputs:_ `results/DLPFC/fPCA.RData`, `data/DLPFC/analyzed_data.RData`, figures  
  _Note:_ `results/DLPFC/domain_input_for_FPCA.RData` is saved for timing scripts.

- **Decide NSC**: Elbow on normalized residuals.  
  _Outputs:_ `images/DLPFC/NSC_optimization/Optimal_nComp_Selection.pdf`, `results/DLPFC/nComp_opt.RData`

- **Clustering**: Walktrap on fPCA components (HR grid + back-projection). ARI scoring. Label alignment.  
  _Outputs:_ `results/DLPFC/fPCA_clustering_results_GCV_NoMean_{NSC}.RData` and `_ALIGNED_...`, per-KNN PDFs

- **Visualization**: GT vs SPCA vs fPCA maps; selected spatial components (scaled/unscaled).  
  _Outputs:_ PDFs in `images/DLPFC/manuscript/`
